### Labs Projects

LFDT Labs serves as an incubator space where ideas can flourish before moving into formal project status. Labs allow for experimentation, demos, hackathon outputs, or proof-of-concept code.

Examples of existing Labs:

- **Blockchain Explorer** – A tool for exploring blockchain transaction data and network state.  
- **Blockchain Automation Framework Lab** – Tools to streamline deployment and management of blockchain components.  
- **Solang Lab** – Experimental implementation of the Solang compiler in LFDT’s lab environment.  
- **AI FAQ 2025** – Research-oriented initiative focused on applying AI to LFDT use cases.  
- **YUI Lab** – Experiments in user interface and developer experience design.  
- **Agora** – A collaborative environment for decentralized governance and decision-making.  
- **Open Enterprise Agent** – Early exploration of verifiable credential agents for enterprises.  

More details on each lab (including descriptions, repositories, and stewards) are available through the LFDT Labs GitHub organization or Wiki.

### Non-code Projects

LFDT encourages contributions beyond code, including:

- **Documentation Initiatives** – Guides, glossaries, or walkthroughs that improve project onboarding, usage, and standards.  
- **Community Outreach** – Supporting regional chapters, meetups, mailing lists, Discord engagement, and website content improvements.  
- **Governance & Policy Documents** – Contributions to proposal templates, project charter content, branding & guidelines, and codes of conduct.
