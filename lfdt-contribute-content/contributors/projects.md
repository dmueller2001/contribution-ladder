# LFDT Projects

LFDT projects will be listed here by maturity level (Graduated, Incubating, Labs) with links to contribution guides and primary languages.

- Graduated Projects — stable governance, high adoption.
- Incubating Projects — growing adoption and governance maturity.
- Labs — early‑stage experiments.

(TODO: Replace with LFDT’s authoritative project list and links.)
