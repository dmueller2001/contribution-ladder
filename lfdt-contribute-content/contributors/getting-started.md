# Do you want to start contributing to open source and need help figuring out where to begin?

### Introduction
Open source is a way of building software together — grounded in collaboration, transparency, and community. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, contributing is an opportunity to learn, teach, and make an impact.

In this document, we’ll explore how to get involved, what skills help, and how to become part of the community.

### Join the Community
Most projects have a website or a GitHub repository with contribution information. Look for:
- Communication channels (mailing lists, chat, forums, issue trackers)
- A `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Labels like **good first issue** and **help wanted**

### Understand “Community”
Open‑source communities thrive on inclusivity and collaboration. Follow the project’s code of conduct, be respectful, and learn the norms of communication and review.

### Choose a Project
Pick projects aligned with your interests and skills. Start by reading docs, trying a tutorial, and using the software yourself. This helps you find concrete areas to contribute.

### Read the Documentation
Review READMEs, contributor guides, and meeting notes. Scan open and recently closed issues/PRs to understand current priorities and norms.

### Start Small
Begin with small issues or documentation fixes. As confidence grows, take on bigger tasks.

### Collaborate & Ask for Help
Work with other contributors through code/document reviews and testing. Ask project‑specific questions after you’ve read the relevant docs or tried the steps.

### Code & Non‑Code Paths
- **Code:** languages, testing, CI, security basics, and code review etiquette.
- **Non‑Code:** documentation, design/UX, translations, community moderation, release notes, and more.

### Git, Pull Requests, and Issues
Most projects use GitHub/GitLab for contribution flows. Learn how to fork, branch, commit, open issues, and create PRs. See GitHub docs on SSH keys and 2FA for account security.

### Why projects seek new contributors
Healthy projects need a steady influx of contributors for sustainability, diversity of thought, and shared ownership. You’ll gain skills, collaborators, and a public body of work.

### In conclusion
Contributing to open source is a great way to grow your skills and give back. Start small, be collaborative, and respect community norms. Welcome aboard!
