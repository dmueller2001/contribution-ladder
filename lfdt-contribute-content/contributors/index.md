# Contribute to the LFDT Ecosystem

Welcome! Are you interested in contributing to one of **LFDT**‑hosted projects? This site contains information and guidelines about contributions across LFDT projects.

Contributing to the LFDT ecosystem isn’t just about coding. You can also help by writing documentation, creating tutorials, bringing ideas to meetings, organizing meetups, and more.

## Open Source Beginners
Are you new to open source? Check out our guide: [Start Contributing to Open Source](getting-started.md). It’s filled with tips on joining communities, finding projects, and understanding community standards.

## Unknown Terms?
If you encounter unfamiliar terms in this site, consult the **Glossary** (TODO: link LFDT glossary).

## Contribution Opportunities

### Mentorship Programs
LFDT can participate in or mirror the following programs:
- **LFX Mentorship** — Linux Foundation’s mentorship platform (program details vary by year).
- **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** — project‑based internships for newcomers.
- **Outreachy** — internships supporting contributors from groups underrepresented in tech.

See also the LFDT mentoring materials (TODO: link LFDT mentoring repo).

### Project Opportunities
- Explore the (future) **LFDT Landscape** — a map of LFDT projects and maturity levels. (TODO: link when available)
- Try **CLOTributor** for beginner‑friendly tasks across open source projects (external tool).

### Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) & Working Groups (WGs)
LFDT TAGs advise the foundation on thematic areas. WGs operate under TAGs with narrower scope. Meetings are open to observers and contributors. (TODO: link LFDT TAG/WG index)

### Community Groups & Ambassadors
Local meetups and evangelist programs help grow the ecosystem. (TODO: link LFDT Community programs)

## Projects
An LFDT projects list (graduated, incubating, labs) will live here. (TODO: insert when finalized.)
