# FAQ — Project Services

**I want to donate a project to LFDT.**  
Great! Please contact the LFDT TAC/TSC intake (TODO: link) and review the governance/onboarding docs.

**Is there an SLA for Service Desk issues?**  
Define a reasonable response time (e.g., 48 hours) and publish it here. (TODO)

**How much budget is available for projects?**  
LFDT can scope budgets on a case‑by‑case basis; publish guidelines and the intake form here. (TODO)
