# Project Services

LFDT aims to provide a backbone of services to help projects with needs beyond code management and technical decisions. Professional staff and community contributors can help cultivate maturity and increase adoption of open‑source projects.

**Example service areas (customize for LFDT):**
- Service Desk → **LFDT Service Desk** (TODO: link/contact)
- Event services → **LFDT events support** (TODO)
- Marketing/comms support (launches, blogs, design) (TODO)
- Code analysis & security audits (OpenSSF‑aligned) (TODO)
- Hosted tools/resources (infra credits, CI, hosting) (TODO)
- Technical writing/program management (TODO)

See the [FAQ](faq.md).
