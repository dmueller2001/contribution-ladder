# Contributor Ladder Task Force

## Purpose

This task force is focused on developing best practices and reusable guidance to help LF Decentralized Trust (LF/DT) projects onboard, grow, and recognize contributors. Our scope includes:

- Defining contributor ladders to support progression from first-time contributors to maintainers and project leaders.
- Establishing guidance for `ADOPTERS.md` files as tools for trust, visibility, and identifying future contributors from end-user organizations.

Together, these practices aim to improve contributor engagement, transparency, and ecosystem maturity across LF/DT projects.

## Goals

1. Define contributor ladders appropriate for LF/DT project types (code, specification, tooling, etc.).
2. Recommend onboarding, mentorship, and recognition strategies to grow contributor engagement.
3. Establish best practices for `ADOPTERS.md` files, including:
   - Clear definitions (e.g., direct vs. transitive adopters)
   - Suggested formats and structure
   - Strategic use in community building, elections, and reporting
4. Highlight how adopter visibility can help surface future contributors from end-user organizations.
5. Provide reusable templates and examples for both contributor ladders and adopters.md files.
6. Recommend ways to integrate these practices into LF/DT project governance and reporting.
