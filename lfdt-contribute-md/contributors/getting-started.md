# Getting Started with Open Source (LFDT)

New to open source? This guide explains how communities work, how to find a project, 
and what to expect as a contributor in the LFDT ecosystem.

- Learn the Git/GitHub workflow and start with issues labeled **good first issue**.
- Join community meetings and read the project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- Prefer smaller PRs with clear scope and tests.
