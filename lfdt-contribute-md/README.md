# Contribute to the LFDT Ecosystem (Markdown Scaffold)

This repository is a Markdown-only scaffold for a future **contribute.lfdt.io** site.  
It was adapted from the public content at **contribute.cncf.io** (licensed CC BY 4.0)
and the **cncf/tag-contributor-strategy** repository (Apache-2.0).

## What’s here
- A clean folder tree of pages as **.md** files with CNCF → LFDT substitutions.
- Content is normalized to Markdown so you can drop it into GitHub Pages, Docusaurus, Hugo/Docsy, MkDocs, or Netlify.
- Attribution is included in `LICENSES/` and `NOTICE.md`.

> Tip: If you plan to publish quickly, Docusaurus or Hugo/Docsy are both good choices. This scaffold keeps the content portable.

## How to use
1. Create a new GitHub repo and upload this folder.
2. Choose a static site generator (or use GitHub Pages for simple rendering).
3. Replace placeholder links (marked with `TODO:`) for LFDT equivalents.
4. Keep the attribution footers and `NOTICE.md` to honor upstream licenses.
